Hello!!

This is a python script that you run via:
	
	nscan target_ip

The first step is to run a fast scan checking only the top 100 ports.

Second step is to do a full scan checking all 65535 ports.

Third is to take the list of ports from teh full scan and to do a deatiled scan of just tose ports.

Hope you have a good day!!
